- [ ] Fix critical bugs that cause crashes or wrong output
  - [ ] Fix memory leak in test.h - loadShaderFromPath returns new char[] that is never deleted
  - [ ] Fix normals not loaded from OBJ vn tokens in OBJ2MeshParser (ivn is computed but thrown away)
  - [ ] Fix out-of-bounds crash when vt index is -1 in OBJ2MeshParser (m_vertexTextures[-1] is UB)
  - [ ] Fix wrong normal attribute size in Mesh::build() - uses 2 instead of 3 components
  - [ ] Fix missing draw call between mesh.bind() and mesh.unbind() in main.cpp (nothing is rendered)
  - [ ] Fix Renderer copies entire scene every frame causing GPU use-after-free (getGameObjects returns by value, copies Mesh with OpenGL handles)

- [ ] Fix high priority design flaws
  - [ ] Implement assets system - remove all hardcoded absolute paths in main.cpp and test.h
  - [ ] Replace all std::cerr/cout with Logger (Logger is unused, add to Window, Shader, ShaderProgram, OBJ2MeshParser)
  - [ ] Add delta-time to game loop for frame-rate independent movement
  - [ ] Move camera controls from main.cpp into Camera class with update(float deltaTime)
  - [ ] Remove duplicate getGameObjects() methods in Scene class
  - [ ] Fix all getters to return const references instead of copies (GameObject::getMeshRenderer, GameObject::getTransform, MeshRenderer::getMesh, MeshRenderer::getMaterial, Transform getters)
  - [ ] Fix Material stores raw owning pointer to ShaderProgram - use shared_ptr or document ownership
  - [ ] Fix Window stores const char* title causing dangling pointer risk
  - [ ] Fix Camera constructors duplicate 90% of code - use delegating constructors or single constructor
  - [ ] Fix OBJ2MeshParser::source() takes pointer instead of const reference
  - [ ] Fix N-gon triangulation broken in OBJ2MeshParser (5+ vertex polygons silently dropped)
  - [ ] Fix Renderer takes Scene by value causing expensive copy
  - [ ] Fix double glfwTerminate() in Window shutdown (called in destructor and explicitly)
  - [ ] Remove duplicate isKeyPressed()/getKey() methods in Window class
  - [ ] Fix LoggingType enum unused - delete or integrate with Logger
  - [ ] Fix missing #include in StringUtils.h (<vector> and <sstream>)

- [ ] Implement medium priority architecture improvements
  - [ ] Wire up Renderer class in main.cpp instead of manual draw calls
  - [ ] Separate object drawing from Mesh to Renderer
  - [ ] Implement simple lighting - add normal attributes to shaders and calculate diffuse/specular
  - [ ] Add component lifecycle system with Start() and Update() methods
  - [ ] Add mouse look support to Camera class

- [ ] Fix low priority code style issues
  - [ ] Fix wrong namespace comment in Window.h (says vengine instead of Window)
  - [ ] Fix #define GLM_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL in header file - move to CMakeLists.txt
  - [ ] Fix != false redundant comparison in Renderer.cpp
  - [ ] Fix unused #include <ostream> in Camera.cpp
  - [ ] Fix signed/unsigned loop index in OBJ2MeshParser (use size_t)
  - [ ] Fix wrong cleanup order in Mesh (should delete VAO before buffers)
  - [ ] Fix fixed 512-byte shader info log buffer truncation issue
